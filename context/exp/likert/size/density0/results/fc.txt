I looked at size by the eye test and determined comparability.
I only used my visual capacity to make the judgments between the various circle sizes.
Using the scale of 10 circles presented before the exercise began, I tried to estimate the difference in position of the two circles on that scale.
If they were the same size I put no difference. The rest were based on size differences.
actually no strategy, compared sizes and rated accordingly
I just evaluated based on other circle sizes and the difference and levels between them.
I just compared the two circles side by side and judged whether they were similar size.
I just used my judgement on the sizing of the circles.
That was fun, just tried to pay attention
My strategy was just visual comparisons of both circles. 
I simply went with my gut for most of the scoring. If I felt one circle was particularly bigger than I went in the 7-9 range. If they were similar I went in the 2-5 range. Thanks.
No strategy I just look at the difference of the size.
I think the survey was done very well and have no suggestions
I just simply look and compare closely of the two circles each time.
I did my best to remember all the sizes I was shown from the beginning, and tried to remember how many steps in size existed between each pair.
Comparing visually the relative sizes of the circles
