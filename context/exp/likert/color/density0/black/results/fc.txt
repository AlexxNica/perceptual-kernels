Certain colors like blue/orange were easy to tell that they were completely different. Colors like pinks/reds, or smokey blues/greys, I rated based on how many steps I thought were between them.
I kind of used their relation on the color wheel as a rough guide.
If the colors where somewhat similar they would receive a rating less than 9. Very few colors that were similar or close together
Colors that were in the pinkish, reddish zone, or should I say more feminine were closer to each other than colors that were blue, green and so forth.  If pink was matched with blue, then it would be completely different in color.  Also variations in shades of color would be closer to each other, for example baby blue vs medium blue.
I used no strategy except my visual perception
None. Thank you.
If it was the same color but different hue then I rated it a 7.
no particular strategy, just followed instructions
When there are three colors in the group, I rated colors that are can be considered from the same “family” (e.g. two shades of blue), less extreme than I rated two completely different colors (e.g. pink and green).
I tried to go with my first instinct.

Matched colors and shades to the best of my ability.
I just judged the color swatches and used common knowledge on what appeared to be different between the colors.
Mostly my decisions were based on the actual colors -- if they were the same or in the same color family they were rated with a low number.  If not, they were rated with a higher number.  Using my art background and knowledge of the color wheel helped me to determine some differences as being complete opposites or a mixture of the color and it's opposite (e.g. red and brown -- red and green are opposites, and green mixed with red makes brown.).
whether or not the colors were of completely different shades or not.
