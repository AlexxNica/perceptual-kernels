color families and hues
I assigned a numerical value to the different shades and color differences between both colors.
If the boxes were two completely different colors I chose a '9'. If the colors were shades of each other I usually ranked it 5 or below. If it was sort of close I went in the 6- 8 range. Thanks.
I looked for colors that fell within the same ""family"" e.g. two different shades of blue, and gave it a slightly lower extreme rating than I gave to two completely different colors (e.g. red and green. I did not think the two sets of colors should be rated at the same level of extremity
I grouped blues and purples as more similar. I took the darkness and lightness of the color into consideration. 
just looked at color families
Matched colors and shades to the best of my ability. Accidentally hit 9 for a 1* in this hit.

If it was the same shade (pink/red) then I had to think more about what intensity and how different it was.
I use each number as a shade with zero being identical colors and each number after that a different shade. 9 would be completely different colors from each other.
No comments on this one. Used the same technique as the previous test.
Opposites I'm giving 9.    Same color in different shades I'm giving 5 or 6
First I look at warm vs. cool, then I look at the hue
