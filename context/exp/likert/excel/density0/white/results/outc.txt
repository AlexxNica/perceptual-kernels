 
if they were different colors, but one was dark and one was light, they were more different than ones that were both light or both dark. Different shades of a color were more alike than opposite colors, like red and green.
Light with lighter colors and if two many bold differences, I rated they were very different. (Higher than 5)
This one is harder than the shape. Those with the same color but with different degree of brightness/shades were easy to grade but those with 2 different colors I struggled with. If the colors were adjacent on the color wheel, I placed them closer. If they were very far apart, I just rated them as totally different.
I had no strategy other than looking at the colors.
