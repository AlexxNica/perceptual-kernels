 
I just based it off of if they were in the same color family
If the colors were obviously different (i.e., orange and blue), I would mark them at the end of the spectrum.  If the colors were somewhat similar (lilac, blue) and somewhat light in shade (pale as opposed to a dark shade), I would mark them somewhere in  between.
I was looking at the colors and trying to figure out if they were similar in any way. I was thinking if they were on the same line of color.
I measured the shades of the colors with one hand covering the other shape, and vice-versa.
