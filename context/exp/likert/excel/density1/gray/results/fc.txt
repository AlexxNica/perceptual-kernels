Different shades of the same color rated about a 3. Colors that needed to be mixed with one similar color to match rated about a 5-7.
I was looking for colors that were in the same ""family"" in order to not give it an extreme number (0 vs 9); however, upon looking at the colors shown, they were not close enough to categorize as similar, hence they scored at the extremes
I changed my judgment slightly as I went along. I started marking colors in the same ""family"" (blue & green, for example) as being more similar than red & green, and also pastel shades as more similar than a dark hue and a pastel hue. Basically, though, to me almost everything looked either very different or exactly the same. 
I just tried to go on instinct.
Just looked for same base shades and looked to see how closely related they were.
warm and cool colors
I looked for shades of the same color and give them a rating in the middle.
First I look at warm vs. cool, then I look at the hue.
just went by color rather than overthinking
no particular strategy, just followed instructions
try to put pairs that fall into the same color group >= 7 and really far apart colors such as two that are not in the same color group at all and dark and light colors 7 and above.
no strategy
I use each number as a shade with zero being identical colors and each number after that a different shade. 9 would be completely different colors from each other.
Very high quality survey. I really enjoyed taking it!

Colors that were in the pinkish, reddish zone, or should I say more feminine were closer to each other than colors that were blue, green and so forth.  If pink was matched with blue, then it would be completely different in color.  Also variations in shades of color would be closer to each other, for example baby blue vs medium blue.
Were the colors on opposite sides of the color wheel? Were they adjacent. Relative intensity played a small role as well.
