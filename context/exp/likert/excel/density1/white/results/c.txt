If the colors were similar shade they were closer to my eye. If they were totally opposites like blue and red I chose a larger difference.

Different shades of the same colors are rated 1-2. 3 is the difference between blue and purple. 4-6 are for different colors that may be ""lighter"" or ""darker"" in tone. 7-8 are for different colors with different tone. 9 would be black/white.
no particular strategy, just followed instructions
I based it off of shade and base color.
I rated them near the high end of the scale unless the hue was the same.
instinct
picked the number depending on the varying shades of the colors
Colors that were in the pinkish, reddish zone, or should I say more feminine were closer to each other than colors that were blue, green and so forth.  If pink was matched with blue, then it would be completely different in color.  Also variations in shades of color would be closer to each other, for example baby blue vs medium blue.
I choose between dark and light, then shades.
I tried to go on first instinct.
Opposites I'm giving 9.    Same color in different shades I'm giving 5 or 6
warm vs. cool hue similary
I use each number as a shade with zero being identical colors and each number after that a different shade. 9 would be completely different colors from each other.
i compared hues and tones and the vibrancy of each color and color family.

When there are three colors in the group, I rated colors that can be considered to belong to the same “family” (e.g. two shades of blue), less extreme than I rated two completely different colors (e.g. blue and purple).
Same as previous. The colors that had totally different hues, from the ones that had their base hue similar.
