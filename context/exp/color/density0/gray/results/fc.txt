If they were exactly the same I chose no difference. If they were a different shade of the same color I rated it a 7 or 6 depending on how light it was.
I don't find any two colors so opposed to one another as to deserve a 9. There are different shades of colors and different sets of tone.
I just compared the two colors, and if they both looked similar (a lighter shade of the same color, or they both had the same primary color in their makeup), I rated them low.  If they looked totally different (no shared primary color and appeared very different), I rated them high.
I rated between 5 and 7, the colors that i considered to be in the same tint or hue.
0 meant same. 9 meant different.
No strategy.  It made me think of grade school and using two colors of crayons to make another color. I enjoyed the hit. Thank you.
I thought if they were both warm or cold, then even though they were different, they were less different than say a warm and cold color (blue and red)... so orange and red, would be less diff as another example....
I judged on the base shades, red and brown are closer than brown and blue.
I use each number as a shade with zero being identical colors and each number after that a different shade. 9 would be completely different colors from each other.
I  just chose according to my perception of the colors
relatable colors on the color wheel
If the colors were similar in how dark or light they were even if different colors I said they were similar.
Very good survey. Some colors were hard to judge.
not sure really, i just went with my feeling but i tried to give similar matches the same score when possible. and also tried to makes sure i always got identical ones set to 0
I tried to go on my first instinct.
Opposites I'm giving 9.    Same color in different shades I'm giving 5 or 6
