if colors were of similar groups, like pink and mauve, the number on the scale would be lower. wasn't too many similar colors in this hit
Colors that were in the pinkish, reddish zone, or should I say more feminine were closer to each other than colors that were blue, green and so forth.  If pink was matched with blue, then it would be completely different in color.
I just used basic knowledge on the color scheming.
Tried to match colors according to warmth/tone.
Same strategy as the previous ones.
i used the differences between red green and blue light to decide the degree of difference.
Jus used my visual perception
I would try to see If they were in the same family.
I just went with my instincts
Same colors of different tones I am giving a 5
None
Just matched colors and shades to best of my ability.
None. Thank you.
I tried to go on first instinct.
I tried to keep the color wheel in mind, as well as the tone. Colors that had different tones, or were complementary, I tended to rate as more different.
First I look at warm vs. cool, then I look at the hue.
