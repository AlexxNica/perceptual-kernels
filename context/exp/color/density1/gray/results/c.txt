If they were a bright purple and dark purple I was say they were somewhat different and the same. 
I scored things that were in the same family like pink and red closer together.
no real strategy just based purely on ""feel
Tried to go on instinct.
saturation and color families
similar colors get lower number 
First I looked at warm vs. cool, then I look at the hue
I used a couple of different strategies. I compared the base color of the two colors (ex. green, red, blue) and then I compared the lightness of the two colors (are they both dark colors, light colors). If the two colors are the same base color, I put it a number between but different lightness it was scored between 1-4,  (0 is only for an exact match). Different colors, but same lightness (and vice versa) were scored between 6-8. The last option was only if it was a bright colored square compared to a gray (or shades of gray) square.
I went on more of the basis of primary, secondary, tertiary, complimentary colors. Primary & secondary, etc are more closely related, as complimentary are opposites. Shades or tints are also more closely related than 2 totally different colors.
I used bright color and dark color to differentiate the pairs. 
Opposites I'm giving 9.    Same color in different shades I'm giving 5 or 6

Just selected based on my perception
Just checked whether they were similar or not. Not much of a strategy was used.

When there are three colors in the group, I rated colors that are can be considered from the same “family” (e.g. two shades of blue), less extreme than I rated two completely different colors (e.g. green and brown).
I would recommend a ""skip training"" button for a multiple hit exercise.
I just judged the color swatches and used common knowledge on what appeared to be different between the colors.
Matched colors and shades to the best if my abilities.
