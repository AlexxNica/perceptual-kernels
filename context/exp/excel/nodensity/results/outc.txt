First, I looked at the color of the reference, and picked the (a,b) which was in this color group, regardless of the ""light or darkness"" of the color.  Next, I picked the (a,b) which was closest to the reference color, like blue & green.  Finally, if the colors were really different, I picked the (a,b) which was closest in the ""shade"" of the reference, either ""light"" or ""dark.
