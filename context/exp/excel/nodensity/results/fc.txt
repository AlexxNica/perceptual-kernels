Whatever was closests.
this is nice taks
First it was based on shading, then I looked more at the undertone of the example color.
Thank you. I tried to match the families of colors together.
If it was a lighter shade, then I chose that one. If not, then I chose a solid with a solid, light shade with a light shade. 
I completed the task because making a guess by comparing the colors, I felt that my goal was to just find the colors that were close to the color, I enjoyed the survey
Just tried to match up the colors
If they weren't similar then I looked at how faint or strong the colors were. I also made some pairs, like pink and red or purple and blue.
I tried to pick out which colors would ""bleed"" together the best -- if they were stacked on top of each other, which would be harder to notice from the corner of my eye?
I chose the pairings that seemed warmest and most naturally appealing to my eyes.
Followed instinct to determine similarity.
I continued to look for colors that naturally would lead to another. 
I just picked colors that were most similar.
Went by hue and the n saturation
I tried to remember the reference you gave in the beginning. 
I tried to choose the color that was either a match or was complimentary to the reference color. 
Each colors placement on the color wheel, warm and cool tones, blended colors, and pastels vs bright colors.
lighter or darker if not the same color or shade
Usually I compared based on the hue.  If they were similar, I compared based on the brightness.
