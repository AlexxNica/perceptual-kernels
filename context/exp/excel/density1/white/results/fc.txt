if one was a primary color, I tended to match it ith the other primary. If one was a compound, I tried to chose the closest to any of its primary colors as I can. If no other rules applied, I went by shade.
color family is what I tried to do then by intensity
I tried first to find the closest matches between shades that I could. Failing that, depending on the choices, I chose either a color that matched closely in either darkness or lightness or colors with a natural association (i.e., red and blue making green).
I completed the task by selecting the color that seemed darker or lighter than the referenced color. 
I went by the closest colors that would be nearest each other in the rainbow.  Although a few times, when they really didn't seem to match, then I would match them up by 2 pastels or 2 bolds colors.
I thought about what colors in clothing that I would likely wear to match. 
Mostly just followed gut instinct for what was most similar.
none
I considered these in the following order: shade of the same color, degree of intensity, secondary colors sharing a component color.
Color wheel placement, to the best of my memory, blended colors, and shades.
Tried matching up the colors the best I could
I just picked colors that were similar and tried to arrange them with brightness.
Just tried to guess which colors were closer on the color wheel.
By base color then shade in most instances.
rainbow like
intuition
I tried to think about how the colors went together as natural as possible. 
Usually I compared based on the hue.  If they were similar, I compared based on the brightness.  
I did not use a particular strategy however i went with my best gut feeling and tried to relate the chances of  how certain colours would change if mixed with others.
